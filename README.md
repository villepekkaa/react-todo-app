# React Todo Webapp

This repository contains a single‑developer implementation of a Todo web application created for the Web‑Application Development Project (15 ECTS) course at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. The primary goal of this assignment was to gain hands‑on experience with modern front‑end and back‑end technologies that will be employed in the larger capstone project later in the course.

Assignment consists  8 different parts and this final version has them all built in. 

## Technology Stack
- Front‑end: React (JavaScript)
- Back‑end: Node.js with Express, structured using the Model‑View‑Controller (MVC) pattern
- Database: PostgreSQL (separate instances for development and automated testing)
- Testing: Mocha framework for automated back‑end tests

## Key Features
- User Authentication – A simple registration and login flow; authentication state is persisted in localStorage and cleared when the browser session ends.
- Task Management – Authenticated users can create, view and delete items from the list.
- Robust Architecture – The back‑end follows MVC principles and incorporates centralized error‑handling utilities.
- Automated Testing
